# Obsidian Novel Starter Vault
A starter vault for writing novels and other long-form writing projects in Obsidian.

## How to use this template
1. Download the latest version of this project here.
2. Unzip the downloaded file. You may also move it to another folder on your computer where you want to store your writing project and rename the unzipped folder.
3. Create a new vault in Obsidian and select that existing folder as your vault location.

And that's it! You may delete this README file and edit the vault in any way you like.

## Known issues
* Not an issue with this set of files but Obsidian does not allow users to manually sort files listed in the sidebar, so the order may change as you edit files based on your settings.
